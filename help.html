                                <p>Here's a few recommendations on how to make your profile stand out to photographers shopping for your services:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Add a profile photo to your Picpee profile. Make sure your profile photo is friendly and engaging. The best examples are either your logo or your headshot.</li>
                                    <li>Add images to your portfolio for each service you offer.</li>
                                    <li>Upload unique images for each service you offer instead of using one image.</li>
                                    <li>Remove graphics from your gallery. Images in the gallery should not include any logos, designs, or graphics - only finished, edited photos.</li>
                                    <li>Offer a discount to the 1st 5 photographers who use your services.</li>
                                    <li>Share the link to your Picpee profile with photographers who are looking for editors on social media.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>One of the benefits you get as a vendor on Picpee is access to receive payments via e-wallet!</p>
                                <p>Follow the steps below to get set up to receive payments in Picpee:</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Create your vendor account on the website.</li>
                                    <li>Set your prices, add images to your portfolio, and complete the verification process.</li>
                                    <li>Once your verification tests have been graded, you'll receive an email notifying you of the results of your test.</li>
                                    <li>When you're approved to offer your services on Picpee, you'll see an option in your Picpee profile to connect to your wallet.</li>
                                    <li>Click the option in Step 3 of your profile set up and follow the steps to connect to your wallet.</li>
                                    <li>Enter your banking information where you'd like to receive payments.</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>Payments for completed orders will not be automatically deposited into your bank account. Once the payment has posted to your Picpee account, you'll need to request a payout from your profile. (Click "Pay out funds" from the left navigation panel of your Picpee account.) This will initiate the payout to your bank account, which can take anywhere from 3-14 business days to reach your account depending on your bank's processing times.</p>

                                    <li>Customer refuses to Accept Product: Even though you have completed the order correctly and completely, the customer still refuses the product.</li>
                                    <li>Order cancellation Required: For example, the customer ordered the wrong service or the wrong quantity.</li>
                                    <li>Other reasons: If the problem is not in the above categories, select "Other" and explain specifically.</li>

                                    <li>Read the order requirements carefully and confirm if there are any unclear points.</li>
                                    <li>Limit disputes by proactively proposing solutions instead of confrontation.</li>

                                    <li>Choose your best edited image<br>
                                    Start with your strongest image as the first image in each portfolio. This is the image that will make the first impression on your clients.</li>
                                    <li>Focus on the visual element<br>
                                    Avoid choosing images that are too monotonous, such as empty rooms or uninteresting angles.
                                    For example, with a single exposure portfolio, an overhead shot is not suitable. Choose interior shots with a wide angle.</li>
                                    <li>Diversify and specialize<br>
                                    Show a variety of projects to show that you have experience working on a variety of properties.
                                    Don't just stick to one type of photo. Show off your versatility in editing techniques, especially if you offer add-ons like Virtual Staging, Day to Dusk.</li>
                                    <li>Keep your photo gallery Before/After<br>
                                    Upload before and after photos to help clients see your editing skills.
                                    Note: Don't include text, logos, or graphics. This can be distracting and make clients feel unprofessional.</li>
                                    <li>Update your images regularly<br>
                                    Continuously update your best images, to demonstrate your skills improving over time.</li>
                                    <li>Make sure each photo is relevant to the service it's about<br>
                                    For example, if you're building a portfolio for Virtual Staging, don't use a photo of a city skyline. Choose photos that clearly illustrate the transformation from a bare space to a furnished one.</li>

                                <p>Projects are a convenient way to organize multiple services under one platform. They're perfect for managing everything related to a single real estate listing or campaign.</p>
                                <p>Think of a Project as a folder where you can:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Group all services (editing, virtual staging, morning to night, etc.)</li>
                                    <li>Track the vendors you've hired</li>
                                    <li>Track payment status and project progress</li>
                                    <li>Easily reuse or duplicate services for similar listings in the future</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>On your Projects page, you'll see an overview of all your projects in a grid or list format, including:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Project name</li>

                                    <li>Total amount paid</li>
                                    <li>Status of each service</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>When you open a project, you'll see:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>A summary of services, vendors, and payments</li>
                                    <li>Project-specific actions via the Actions menu (three dots), including: Rename project, copy project, create template from project, add new service and project dispute.</li>
