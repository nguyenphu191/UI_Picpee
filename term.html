                            <p>Only registered users may purchase or sell services through the Picpee platform. Account registration is completely free.

Users are fully responsible for all activities that occur under their account and are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of their login information. Picpee is not responsible for any fraud, errors or negligence related to users' accounts.</p>
                            <p>Orders are created through the Seller's marketplace, from the Projects area, the Buyer's dashboard or through official integrations with the picpee.com website. Picpee does not directly perform the service and therefore does not guarantee or warrant the quality of work performed by service providers on the platform.</p>
                            <p>For fees and payment methods, please refer to Picpee's Payment Terms.</p>
                            <p>Users are not allowed to offer, propose or accept payment through any method other than the official platform at picpee.com. Violation of this provision may result in additional charges, account suspension or permanent ban from the platform (applicable to both Buyers and Sellers).</p>

                            <h3>Overview</h3>
                            <p>Sellers are pre-verified professionals who have passed Picpee's review process to ensure they meet the minimum criteria to provide services on the platform. However, Picpee does not guarantee the quality of service or results of Sellers after initial verification. Sellers are solely responsible for providing and maintaining accurate, up-to-date information.</p>
                            <p>We encourage our Buyer community to provide honest, fair reviews to build and maintain Seller reputation. Picpee reserves the right to adjust a Seller's verification status based on feedback and reviews from Buyers. If, after contacting us, we find a valid reason, we may change the status.</p>
                            <p>Sellers who fail to maintain service levels such as: significantly reduced ratings, late deliveries, increased cancellation rates, or violations of the Terms of Service. May lose visibility on the platform or be subject to internal analysis based on those ratings.</p>
                            <p>Sellers may accept orders manually through Picpee's system or allow automatic order acceptance when a Buyer submits a service request. All orders must be completed by the agreed deadline. Failure to deliver on time may result in penalties, account suspension, or permanent ban from the platform.</p>
                            <p>Sellers must deliver all service products, including documents, files, and data, to the storage location designated by the Buyer.</p>
                            <p>Sellers will receive a percentage of the order value. For more information on payments, fees, and tax obligations, please refer to the Payment Terms.</p>
                            <p>Payments to Sellers will be processed once Picpee has received funds from the payment processor and the order has been marked as "delivered" and accepted by the Buyer (or automatically accepted within 72 hours if the Buyer does not request a correction). Payments will be credited to the Seller's Picpee account and then the Seller must transfer the funds to their bank account. Processing may take between 3 and 14 business days and is dependent on the payment processor's processes, which are beyond Picpee's control.</p>
                            <p>Sellers may not advertise or offer their Services directly to Buyers outside of the Picpee platform once a relationship has been established on the platform. Any violation of this may result in Picpee taking legal action and recovering fees paid through the violation.</p>
                            <p>In the event of suspicious signs of fraud or illegal activity, Picpee reserves the right to temporarily or permanently disable the Seller's withdrawal function to protect the financial safety of all parties involved.</p>
                            <p>If the Seller fails to complete the account connection with Picpee for payment within 12 months, all balances in the account will be forfeited and Picpee reserves the right to dispose of such funds.</p>
                            <p>It is the Seller's responsibility to provide general liability insurance with adequate coverage to cover the risks arising during the provision of the service.</p>
                            <p>Finally, the Seller is not allowed to intentionally copy or counterfeit the name, brand, portfolio or any content of another Seller's profile on the platform.</p>

                            <p>Violations may result in the suspension of the Seller's account or the imposition of additional processing fees. The fees applied per violation may increase depending on the severity and frequency of the violation. These fees will be deducted directly from the Seller's connected payment account.</p>
                            <p>A Seller who is removed from the platform for a violation will not be eligible for account reinstatement. Additionally, a Seller may be removed from Picpee's Search function for poor performance or violations of the Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, or other legitimate reasons at our sole discretion. If Picpee discovers that a previously banned Seller is operating through a new account. That new account may be suspended or terminated immediately without notice.</p>
                            <p>In the event that a Seller is found to be in violation of labor laws or other applicable laws in the jurisdiction where they reside or operate, we reserve the right to suspend or terminate the account at our sole discretion.</p>

                            <p>Once payment is confirmed, an Order will be created and a unique order number will be issued from Picpee.</p>
                            <p>When a Buyer submits an Order, the Seller will receive a notification on the Platform when logged into their account. It is the Seller's responsibility to adhere to the delivery deadlines agreed upon with the Buyer during the service and availability setup. Failure to adhere to these deadlines may result in the Buyer marking the Order as late, creating a complaint, and affecting the Seller's verification status.</p>
                            <p>The Seller must submit the completed files via the storage location designated by the Buyer, and use the "Delivery" button on the Order page to mark the Order as delivered.</p>
                            <p>The Buyer may use the "Request Revision" feature on the Order if the delivery content does not match the service description or original request. Any changes after the Order has been marked as "Delivered" are considered a Revision.</p>
                            <p>An Order will only be marked as Complete after both conditions are met: (1) Marked as "Delivered" and (2) Expressly Accepted by the Buyer. If after 72 hours of delivery the Buyer has neither accepted nor requested any amendments, the Order will be automatically marked as Complete and deemed accepted.</p>
                            <p>The "Delivered" feature may not be misused to circumvent the order fulfillment process set out in the Terms of Service. Use of this button when the job is not yet complete may result in the cancellation of the order, affect the verification status, and result in warnings or additional processing fees for the Seller.</p>
                            <p>It is the User's responsibility to scan all transferred files for viruses or malware. Picpee is not responsible for any damages arising from the use of the Platform, content provided, or files related to the Order, including files submitted by the Buyer or Seller.</p>
